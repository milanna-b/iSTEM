                    Welcome to the Institute for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (iSTEM) program!
                    
                    At Countryside High School, we offer two tracks tailored to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our students: the vocational track and the scholar track. Our 
                    vocational track provides hands-on training in the IT field, allowing students to specialize in areas such as Computer Systems and Information Technology (CSIT), 
                    Game Design, Web Design, and Digital Design. Our scholar track offers a rigorous academic curriculum with a focus on STEM subjects, preparing students for future 
                    success in fields such as Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, and Engineering.
                    
                    Through interdisciplinary coursework, real-world applications, and opportunities for industry certifications, iSTEM equips students with the skills, knowledge, 
                    and experiences needed to thrive in today's ever-evolving technological landscape. Whether you're passionate about IT or exploring the frontiers of scientific 
                    discovery, iSTEM provides a supportive environment where students can pursue their passions and achieve their full potential.
